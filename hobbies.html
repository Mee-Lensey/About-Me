         <h3 style="text-align:center">Exploring</h3>
        <p>This is me and my friends exploring New York City during the summer before my senior year of high school. We visited many iconic places such as Central Park, Times Square, and the Statue of Liberty. It was an unforgettable experience filled with laughter and adventure.</p>
         
         <h3 style="text-align:center">Working Out</h3>
         <p></p>This was my first time going to the gym at Milton during freshman year. I really enjoyed working out with my friends and learning new exercises. I try to go to the gym at least three times a week to stay active and healthy. The person above me is my current roommate Anthony Landolfi who introduced me to the gym.</p>

         <h3 style="text-align:center">Watching Shows</h3>

            <p>This is a picture of my favorite show Cobra Kai. I love watching this show because it combines action, drama, and comedy in a unique way. The characters are well-developed, and the storyline keeps me hooked. Watching shows like Cobra Kai is one of my favorite ways to relax and unwind after a long day.</p>
